        <p>welcome to the bucket.</p>

        <p>i spent quite a considerable amount of time thinking of a name for this website and for myself in general. you'd know me around as bucketfish, perhaps, and therefore i live in a bucket. it's quite a lovely place to be in, especially during the rain. (metal go clicky.)</p>

        <p>it if seems like i'm rambling and not talking about a lot in general, i am. i didn't have any plans when i made this website. a lot of it will change as we go. but why would that stop me? why would that stop anyone? life is full of exploration, i suppose, and stuff.</p>

        <p>so perhaps you could stick around for a while - enough to catch your breath - and take a break in the bucket with me.</p>

        <p>i'm just a fish vibing in the sea. until i'm not.</p>
