        <p>ways i've spelt it incorrectly:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>miscellanious</li>
          <li>miscelanious</li>
          <li>miscellanous</li>
        </ul>

        <p>besides just toki pona, i do have quite a number of other hobbies and nowhere good to develop them. so i'll just dump it all here. woo.</p>

        <h2>coding</h2>
        <p>like, i know coding is a very vague term but . idk. like i do web dev and game dev and competitive and idk but i don't <em> really </em> do a lot of things. y'know.</p>
        <p>like i look at my folder on my desktop called 'code' and there are so many things inside but i've not finished or released like 90% of them and i don't know what i'm gonna do with it. :)</p>
        <p>languages i know include c++, swift, html, python, css, javascript, java, in order of fluency.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>box arena, a text-based dungeon crawler (no link. yet.)</li>
          <li>sfx, a text-based roleplay? game. (also no link yet i'll figure these out Sometime)</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>writing</h2>
        <p>fun fact, i actually really like to write! unfortunately, that's the funnest fact we've got in this subsection.</p>
        <p>i used to write like, a lot, until i didn't. and then idk. i have tons of poems and drafts stored away that i've written years ago. and some recent ones that i never feel good enough to publish.</p>
        <p>actually... maybe i'll just dump them here.</p>

        <h2>music</h2>
        <p>honestly, besides toki pona music, i haven't made much other music. actually i do. but like not consistently.</p>

        </ul>
