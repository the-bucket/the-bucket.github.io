          <p>oh, look, i really like writing in the afternoon. i guess this is the only time i get like, Time, y'know.</p>
          <p>today i did? i'm not sure. school kinda takes up like , All of the time.. so i suppose i did school. which isn't the best thing to do in the middle of february. but who am i to complain?</p>
          <p>either way, i completed a bit more of the website today. still debating on which categories to keep as categories and which to put under 'misc'. maybe i'll add some secret pages and shit. we'll see :)</p>
          <p>still very sleepy. but i half-slept for 10 minutes earlier, so everything should be fine. i've got a meeting in about 30 minutes. urgh.</p>

          <p>hey! look. here's a site. today i started working on the bucket.</p>
          <p>i used to keep wanting to make a website for stuff i'm working on, but i never did it. i kept making sites and trashing them because i really didn't vibe with it.</p>
          <p>so here. in this page. inconsistent posts, rants, spelling and grammar mistakes, all that good stuff. hope you enjoy <3</p>
          <p>ps: i am so sleepy.</p>
