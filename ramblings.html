          <p>hey! look. here's a site. today i started working on the bucket.</p>
          <p>i used to keep wanting to make a website for stuff i'm working on, but i never did it. i kept making sites and trashing them because i really didn't vibe with it.</p>
          <p>so here. in this page. inconsistent posts, rants, spelling and grammar mistakes, all that good stuff. hope you enjoy <3</p>
          <p>ps: i am so sleepy.</p>
